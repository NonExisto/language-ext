/// A typical use of domain types is representing quantities, such as the amount of money in USD in a bank account,
/// or the file-size in bytes. Being able to compare, add, and subtract amounts is essential.
/// 
/// Generally, we cannot multiply or divide two compatible amounts and expect to get the amount of the same type back. 
///
/// Unless we’re modeling mathematical entities, such as probabilities or points on an elliptic curve.. Multiplying two
/// dollars by two dollars gives four squared dollars. I don’t know about you, but I’m yet to find a practical use for
/// squared dollars.
/// 
/// Multiplying amounts by a dimensionless number, however, is meaningful. There is nothing wrong with a banking app
/// increasing a dollar amount by ten percent or a disk utility dividing the total number of allocated bytes by the file
/// count.
/// 
/// The appropriate mathematical abstraction for amounts is vector spaces. Vector space is a set with additional
/// operations defined on the elements of this set: addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, such that
/// behaviors of these operations satisfy a few natural axioms.
