    /// Generates a new reference that can be used within a `sync` transaction

    /// `Refs` ensure safe shared use of mutable storage locations via a software transactional 
    /// memory (STM) system. `Refs` are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime, 
    /// and only allow mutation of that location to occur within a transaction.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// 
    /// Transactions (within a `sync(() => ...)`) should be easy to understand if you’ve ever used database 
    /// transactions - they ensure that all actions on Refs are atomic, consistent, and isolated. 
    /// 
    ///  * **Atomic** - means that every change to Refs made within a transaction occurs or none do. 
    ///  * **Consistent** - means that each new value can be checked with a validator function before allowing 
    /// the transaction to commit. 
    ///  * **Isolated** - means that no transaction sees the effects of any other transaction while it is 
    /// running. 
    /// 
    /// Another feature common to STMs is that, should a transaction have a conflict while running, 
    /// it is automatically retried.  The language-ext STM uses multi-version concurrency control for 
    /// snapshot and serialisable isolation.
    /// 
    /// In practice, this means:
    ///
    /// All reads of Refs will see a consistent snapshot of the _Ref world_ as of the starting point 
    /// of the transaction (its 'read point'). The transaction will see any changes it has made. 
    /// This is called the in-transaction-value.
    ///
    /// All changes made to Refs during a transaction will appear to occur at a single point in the 
    /// _Ref world_ timeline (its 'write point').
    ///
    /// No changes will have been made by any other transactions to any Refs that have been modified 
    /// by this transaction.
    ///
    ///  * Readers will never block writers, or other readers.
    ///
    ///  * Writers will never block readers.
    ///
    /// I/O and other activities with side effects should be avoided in transactions, since transactions 
    /// will be retried. 
    ///
    /// If a constraint on the validity of a value of a Ref that is being changed depends upon the 
    /// simultaneous value of a Ref that is not being changed, that second Ref can be protected from 
    /// modification by running the `sync` transaction with `Isolation.Serialisable`.
    ///
    /// The language-ext STM is designed to work with the persistent collections (`Map`, `HashMap`, 
    /// `Seq`, `Lst`, `Set, `HashSet` etc.), and it is strongly recommended that you use the language-ext 
    /// collections as the values of your Refs. Since all work done in an STM transaction is speculative, 
    /// it is imperative that there be a low cost to making copies and modifications. Persistent collections 
    /// have free copies (just use the original, it can’t be changed), and 'modifications' share structure
