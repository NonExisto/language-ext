/// The `Async` module helps transition away from the `Task` / `async` / `await` world and into one
/// where awaiting is the default setting for concurrent programming and branching/forking is the
/// thing we do the least.
///
/// The `Async.await` function will convert a `Task&lt;A&gt;` into an `A` by waiting for the `Task` to
/// complete; it will yield the thread whilst it's waiting (to play nice with other tasks in the
/// task-pool).  This is just like the regular `await` keyword without all the ceremony and
/// colouring of methods.
///
/// `Async.fork` lifts a function into an IO monad, forks it, and then runs the IO monad returning
/// a `ForkIO` object.  The forked operation continues to run in parallel.  The `ForkIO` object
/// contains two properties: `Await` and `Cancel` that be used to either await the result or
/// cancel the operation.
///
/// These two functions remove the need for methods that are 'tainted' with `Task` or `async` /
/// `await` mechanics and assume that the thing we will do the most with asynchronous code is to
/// await it.
///
/// This module shouldn't be needed too much, as the IO monad is where most of the asynchrony
/// should be. But, when converting from existing async/await code, or if you're coming from
/// language-ext v4, or earlier, where there was lots of `*Async` methods in the key types, then
/// this module will help ease the transition.
