/// <summary>
/// Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state without 
/// locks. 
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The intended use of atom is to hold an immutable data structure. You change 
/// the value by applying a function to the old value. This is done in an atomic 
/// manner by `Swap`.  
/// 
/// Internally, `Swap` reads the current value, applies the function to it, and 
/// attempts to `CompareExchange` it in. Since another thread may have changed the 
/// value in the intervening time, it may have to retry, and does so in a spin loop. 
/// 
/// The net effect is that the value will always be the result of the application 
/// of the supplied function to a current value, atomically. However, because the 
/// function might be called multiple times, it must be free of side effects.
/// 
/// Atoms are an efficient way to represent some state that will never need to be 
/// coordinated with any other, and for which you wish to make synchronous changes.
